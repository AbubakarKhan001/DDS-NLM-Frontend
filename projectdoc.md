# DSS Workflow Project Prompt for Cursor IDE
The DSS Workflow Project is an AI-driven Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real-time network monitoring, intelligent anomaly detection, and autonomous threat response. This project aims to enhance network security by proactively identifying and mitigating cyber threats, reducing manual intervention, and providing actionable post-incident insights. It integrates traditional machine learning models for baseline anomaly detection with advanced agent-based AI workflows using large language models (LLMs). The project adheres to ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and OCTAVE Allegro risk assessment methodologies, following an Action Design Research (ADR) iterative development approach.

## Objectives

  * **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously ingest and process network logs to detect anomalies.
  * **Automated Threat Detection:** Use supervised machine learning (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to identify normal vs. anomalous network behavior.
  * **Agentic AI Workflow:** Implement a triage agent for initial log assessment and specialized LLM sub-agents for in-depth analysis, with human-in-the-loop (HITL) integration for ambiguous cases.
  * **Autonomous Response:** Automatically block malicious IPs, categorize threats, and log incidents in a knowledge base.
  * **Post-Incident Support:** Develop an AI-powered chatbot to provide administrators with recovery recommendations based on security policies.
  * **Visualization:** Create real-time dashboards for monitoring and alerts using JavaScript and Power BI.

## System Features

Based on the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), the system includes:

  * **Log Ingestion Module:** Ingests and normalizes network logs in real time.
  * **ML-Based Threat Detection:** Uses SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression with preprocessing (StandardScaler, SMOTE).
  * **Agentic AI Workflow:**
      * **Triage Agent:** Scans logs for suspicious activity.
      * **LLM Sub-Agent:** Performs detailed analysis of flagged events.
      * **HITL:** Notifies administrators for high-uncertainty cases.
  * **Autonomous Response System:** Executes actions like IP blocking and threat categorization.
  * **Post-Incident Chatbot:** Provides policy-based recovery advice.
  * **Visualization and Dashboards:** Displays real-time log activity and alerts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

  * **Performance:** Detection latency \<1 second, accuracy \>95%.
  * **Security:** HTTPS, role-based access control, audit logs.
  * **Availability:** 99.9% uptime with automated failover.
  * **Maintainability:** Modular architecture with CI/CD pipelines.
  * **Usability:** Responsive web interface with configurable alerts.

### 4\. Machine Learning Integration

  * **Train Models:** Preprocess data and train ML models (e.g., Random Forest) for anomaly detection.

  * **Load Models:** Load models during app startup and use in log processing.
    ```python
    scaler = None
    rf_model = None

    @app.on_event("startup")
    async def load_ml_models(): # Renamed to avoid conflict with on_startup
        global scaler, rf_model
        try:
            scaler = joblib.load("ml_models/scaler.pkl")
            rf_model = joblib.load("ml_models/rf_model.pkl")
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("ML models not found. Please run train_models() first.")
            # Optionally, call train_models() here if you want to train on startup
            # train_models()
            # scaler = joblib.load("ml_models/scaler.pkl")
            # rf_model = joblib.load("ml_models/rf_model.pkl")


    def extract_features(log_data: str):
        # Placeholder: Implement actual feature extraction based on your log format
        # This should parse log_data and return numerical features
        # For example, if log_data is "dur=1.2 spkts=10 dpkts=5 sbytes=100 dbytes=50"
        # you would parse these values.
        # For demonstration, returning dummy values:
        import random
        return [random.uniform(0.1, 5.0), random.randint(1, 20), random.randint(1, 10), random.randint(50, 500), random.randint(20, 200)]

    def process_log(log: Log):
        if scaler is None or rf_model is None:
            print("ML models not loaded, skipping log processing.")
            return

        features = extract_features(log.log_data)
        scaled_features = scaler.transform([features])
        prediction = rf_model.predict(scaled_features)[0]
        if prediction == 1: # Assuming 1 indicates anomaly
            print(f"Anomaly detected for log: {log.id}. Triggering agentic workflow.")
            # trigger_agentic_workflow(log) # Uncomment and implement this function
        else:
            print(f"Log {log.id} is normal.")
    ```

### 5\. OpenAI Agents SDK Integration

  * **Define Agents:** Create triage, analysis, and chatbot agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK.
    ```python
    from openai_agents import Agent, Tool, AgentRunner # Corrected import based on typical SDK usage
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class BlockIPInput(BaseModel):
        ip: str

    # Define the tool function outside the agent definition for clarity
    def block_ip(input: BlockIPInput):
        # Implement actual IP blocking logic here (e.g., call firewall API)
        print(f"Simulating IP blocking for: {input.ip}")
        return {"status": f"Blocked IP {input.ip}"}

    triage_agent = Agent(
        name="triage_agent",
        instructions="Analyze network logs for suspicious activity. Escalate to analysis_agent if anomaly detected.",
        model="gpt-4o",
        handoffs=["analysis_agent"]
    )

    analysis_agent = Agent(
        name="analysis_agent",
        instructions="Perform deep analysis of suspicious logs, classify threat, and suggest actions. Use the 'block_ip' tool if a malicious IP is identified.",
        model="gpt-4o",
        tools=[Tool(name="block_ip", description="Block a malicious IP address", input_model=BlockIPInput, function=block_ip)]
    )

    chatbot_agent = Agent(
        name="chatbot_agent",
        instructions="Provide post-incident guidance based on security policies and incident history. Access incident details to give relevant advice.",
        model="gpt-4o"
    )

    # Initialize the AgentRunner
    runner = AgentRunner(agents=[triage_agent, analysis_agent, chatbot_agent])

    async def trigger_agentic_workflow(log: Log):
        print(f"Triggering agentic workflow for log ID: {log.id}")
        # The prompt implies a single run from triage, then possible handoff to analysis.
        # You might need more sophisticated state management for full workflow.
        initial_response = await runner.run(triage_agent, log.log_data)
        print(f"Triage agent response: {initial_response.output}")

        if initial_response.handoff_to == "analysis_agent":
            print("Handoff to analysis agent.")
            analysis_response = await runner.run(analysis_agent, log.log_data)
            print(f"Analysis agent response: {analysis_response.output}")
            # Here you would parse analysis_response to trigger actions like IP blocking,
            # and log the incident to the database.
            # Example: if analysis_response.output contains an IP to block:
            # await analysis_agent.call_tool("block_ip", BlockIPInput(ip="192.168.1.1"))
    ```
  * **Chatbot Endpoint:**
    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
        message: str

    @app.post("/chatbot")
    async def chat_with_bot(request: ChatRequest):
        print(f"Chatbot request received: {request.message}")
        response = await runner.run(chatbot_agent, request.message)
        print(f"Chatbot response: {response.output}")
        return {"response": response.output} # Access .output for the actual text response
    ```

### 6\. Visualization and Dashboards

  * **API for Visualization:** Provide endpoints for frontend data.
    ```python
    @app.get("/dashboard/logs")
    async def get_logs(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
        return db.exec(select(Log)).all()

    # You might want more specific endpoints for alerts, incident summaries, etc.
    @app.get("/dashboard/alerts")
    async def get_current_alerts():
        # This would fetch real-time alerts, potentially from a cache or in-memory store
        return {"alerts": ["Alert 1: High CPU Usage", "Alert 2: Unusual Login Attempt"]}
    ```
  * **Frontend Integration:** Use JavaScript (e.g., Chart.js) for client-side visualization, with Power BI for advanced analytics (configured separately).

-----

### 7\. Compliance and Security

  * **Encryption:** Use HTTPS for API communication (handled by Uvicorn in production).
  * **Role-Based Access:** Implement middleware for authentication (e.g., OAuth2 with FastAPI).
    ```python
    from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
    from fastapi import HTTPException, status

    oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

    # In a real application, you'd validate the token against a user database
    # For simplicity, this is a placeholder
    async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
        if token != "supersecrettoken": # Replace with actual token validation
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
            )
        return {"username": "admin"}

    @app.get("/secure/endpoint")
    async def secure_endpoint(user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)):
        return {"message": f"Secure access granted to {user['username']}"}
    ```
  * **Audit Logs:** Log all actions in the database.


### 9\. Deployment Considerations

  * **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy on AWS/GCP with Neon PostgreSQL for scalability.
  * **CI/CD:** Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
  * **Monitoring:** Use logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry) for production.

-----

## Deliverables
